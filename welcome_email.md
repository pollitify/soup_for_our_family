Hello Friend, 

Thank you for applying to the Soup For Our Families grant program and ... YOU HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED!!!

Here's what to expect over the next week or so:

1. A wagon, slow cooker and initial set of ingredients will be sent to you.
2. You will be added to the Food For Our Families pollitify community where you can meet others, look at the recipes and so on.
3. You will be sent YouTube urls from us explaining more about this.
4. A letter of thanks will arrive with a $20 bill inside to let you get any kitchen stuff you need.  We know this isn't a lot but you can make it go far at a thrift store or Good Will.

We do ask that you take some pictures and post them online with the hashtag #FoodForOurFamilies and let us know where you posted them.  This helps us draw attention to your good work.

Thanks again

Team Pollitify
