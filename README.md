Soup For Our Families is an open source, mutual aid approach to feeding Americans in the wake of the SNAP crisis.

## Overview

The cut in SNAP benefits is going to directly impact the food security of 42 million Americans for an indeterminate amount of time.  This is **UNACCEPTABLE**.  It is also **cruel** but in a world where armed, masked fascists flood the streets of Chicago and Portland, it seems like the cruelty is the point.

Here at Pollitify, we are activists and rather than just protest the administration, we thought it was time to take a different, more direct tact and that gave us Soup For Our Family.  The model is simple:

1. We offer a grant program to home cooks who want to feed people.
2. If you sign up, we send you the infrastructure to feed people:
* A wagon to take food into your community
* A slow cooker to cook in and put in the wagon
* A plastic tote keep spills under control and where the slow cooker can sit in the wagon
* A ladle to serve soup with
* A set of paper bowls and spoons
* A set of napkins
* A once a month set of ingredients along with a recipe; we provide the base ingredients and you provide the fresh ingredients
* A $20 bill to go to a local thrift store or Good Will to get a frying pan or other 
* Online Access to a set of recipes and a community of other home cooks to share and collaborate
3. You cook a soup at home and go out into your community to feed people who need food.

## Why Can't You Ship Me All the Ingredients?

Soup Four Our Families is a mutual aid approach to solving the food problem we are currently facing.  Mutual Aid isn't about dependency.  Our goal is to blaze a path and show a way forward.  We want engagement and committment and part of that is allowing everyone to be a part of this.

## What is Open Source?

Open Source is a means of group development, typically for software development, where people work together in a distributed, collaborative means.  If you have ever heard of Linux or Apache or Python -- all of those are Open Source efforts and all of those have literally changed the world.

## Why is this Open Source?

Part of Mutual Aid is transparency.  We want to make our approach to this utterly and completely transparent so we thought rather than run it as a closed program, the better approach was to document everything and let people make their own assessment.

## What is the Budget Behind This?

The Soup For Our Families program is a grant program offered by Pollitify, a software development company focused on tools for activists and organizers.  We have set aside $24,000 from our 1st year budget to enable 60 home cooks to feed people

## How Can 60 Home Cooks Make a Difference?

This is a good question so let's do the math.  The food model we have come up with basically feeds between 8 and 12 people per slow cooker.  So the math is:

60 cooks * 10 meals * 12 months or 7,200 meals over the course of one year.

Yes 7,200 meals is a drop in the the bucket that is 42 million but it also **isn't nothing**.

Our hope is that by open sourcing this project and encouraging people from the tech and online food communities to collaborate on it, we can drive down costs.  If we can decrease costs by 25 % then that means we can feed 9,000 meals over the course of the first year.

And that's assuming that we aren't able to solicit donations / raise funds / etc.
